# Installing and Configuring Apache and PHP in macOS

Be prepared to restart your machine at least twice during this installation.

Follow Andy Miller’s *macOS 13.0 Ventura Apache Setup: Multiple PHP Versions*

1. Once the installation is done, launch your Terminal.
2. Navigate to your `Sites` directory. For example, my folder is in `/Users/royvanegas/Sites`.
3. Clone the test app we’ll need: `git clone git@bitbucket.org:code-warrior/web-app`.
